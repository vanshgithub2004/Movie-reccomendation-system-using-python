Step 2: Install Necessary Libraries
Use pip to install the required libraries:
pip install pandas surprise

Step 3: Download the MovieLens Dataset
Download the MovieLens dataset from here and extract the files. For simplicity, use the ratings.csv file in your code. Place this file in your working directory.

Step 4: Save the Code to a Python File
Save the provided code into a Python file, e.g., movie_recommender.py

Step 5: Run the Python Script
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your movie_recommender.py script, and run the script:
python movie_recommender.py
